## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This application uses the Tkinter library, which is included with Python's standard library.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

Run the script to start the text editor:

```bash
python text_editor.py
```

## Code Explanation

Here is a breakdown of the main components of the script:

### Importing Libraries

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog, messagebox
```

- `tkinter`: The main library for creating the GUI.
- `filedialog`: Used for file open and save dialogs.
- `messagebox`: Used for displaying message boxes.

### TextEditor Class

This class encapsulates the text editor functionality.

#### Initialization

```python
class TextEditor:
    def __init__(self, root):
        ...
```

- Sets up the main window (`root`).
- Initializes the text area, menu, and various menu items.

#### File Operations

- `new_file()`: Clears the text area and resets the title.
- `open_file()`: Opens a file dialog to select a text file and loads its content into the text area.
- `save_file()`: Saves the current content of the text area to a file. If the file is new, a save dialog is shown.
- `delete_file()`: Deletes the current file after confirmation.

#### Edit Operations

- `cut()`: Cuts the selected text.
- `copy()`: Copies the selected text.
- `paste()`: Pastes text from the clipboard.
- `delete()`: Deletes the selected text.

### Running the Application

```python
root = tk.Tk()
text_editor = TextEditor(root)
